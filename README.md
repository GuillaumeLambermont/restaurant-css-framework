## Project description

As of 28th of January 5pm :
This is my css-framework project, I worked on it alone this afternon, at home (thanks Covid).
I used Bootstrap to accomplish some of the features of the website (navbar, form, buttons, col,...).

I finished following the instructions, so I'll be exploring new things and hope to add them to the website before the deadline. **It certainly need some style adjustments to make it more modern**, I'll work on that.


To-do :
- planning first (croquis versions smartphone et destop)
- check if other than 'div' for navbarNav
